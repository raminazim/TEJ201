print(f'Hello, My name is Ramin Raiyan Azim, I was born in Toronto, Ontario Canada, a city in North \n America located in the northern hemisphere of the Earth, which is the third planet from our Sun,\n   which is in the milky way galaxy. I like coding, I code in Python, HTML and CSS. I have \n  been coding since I was 12 years old. I also do graphic design. Check out my page on \n instagram @raminazim.design please do it really helps out. I really like cars as well. My dream \n cars are the 1955 Mercedes Benz SL300 Gullwing, the 1964 Porsche 911, the 2008 \n Lamborghini Reventon and the 2020 Bugatti Chiron Sport Noire. I have tons more but these are \n  the cars I would do anything to own. I also like airplanes, my favorite planes are the Boeing \n 777-300ER and the Airbus A350-1000. They are really cool planes. I also used to play soccer \n in a small league as a defender when we lived in Calgary. I also play volleyball and \n badminton in my free time. What do you like to do? \n I like a couple things about the Reginald Harold King Academy located in Scarborough Ontario \n  (Do not worry I will not yap about the location this time). I like the clubs here, I am apart of \n the Muslim Student Association and the King Technology Council, ran by Mr. David Michaud. I \n also really like the bread rolls they give us. I do not like how much work we get. \n This Summer I have a packed schedule. I am gonna be learning JavaScript, TypeScript and finish \n learning Python, then I am going to make posts for next year for my graphic design business; \n @raminazim.design, please check it out. Really helps me out. Iâ€™m also going to build a car \n game with my friend, Mahran Khandaker. It will be a car game based in Toronto. Thank you \n very much for reading this.')
